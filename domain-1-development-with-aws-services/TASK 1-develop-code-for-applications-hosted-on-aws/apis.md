# APIs

AWS offers several services that help with building and consuming APIs in a scalable and secure manner. APIs are essential for enabling communication between different services or components.

## AWS API Gateway
**API Gateway** is a fully managed service that allows you to create, publish, and maintain secure APIs. You can use it to create RESTful APIs, WebSocket APIs, or HTTP APIs. API Gateway can integrate with **AWS Lambda**, **EC2**, and other AWS services.

## AWS Lambda
AWS **Lambda** is often used in conjunction with API Gateway to create serverless applications. It allows you to run code in response to HTTP requests without provisioning servers.

## Amazon Cognito
For secure API access, **Amazon Cognito** can be used to authenticate users and control access to APIs, ensuring only authorized users can access specific resources.

## Best Practices
- Use **IAM roles** for secure access to APIs.
- Implement **rate limiting** to prevent abuse.
- Use **AWS WAF** (Web Application Firewall) to protect your APIs from malicious traffic.
