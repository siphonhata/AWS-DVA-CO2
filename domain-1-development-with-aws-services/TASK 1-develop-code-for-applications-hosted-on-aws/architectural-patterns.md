# Architectural Patterns

AWS offers several architectural patterns to structure applications efficiently. Understanding these patterns will help in building scalable, resilient, and cost-effective systems.

## Event-Driven Architecture
Event-driven systems react to events or changes in state, and services or functions are triggered by specific events. AWS services like **SNS**, **SQS**, and **Lambda** are key to implementing this pattern.

## Microservices
Microservices break down an application into smaller, independent services that can be developed, deployed, and scaled individually. Services like **ECS**, **EKS**, and **API Gateway** are frequently used in microservices architectures.

## Monolithic Architecture
In a monolithic architecture, all components of an application are tightly integrated and share the same codebase. While this is simpler to develop initially, it becomes difficult to scale and maintain over time.

## Fanout
The fanout pattern involves sending messages to multiple receivers or endpoints simultaneously. This is useful for broadcasting events or notifications to multiple consumers. AWS services like **SNS** facilitate the fanout pattern.
