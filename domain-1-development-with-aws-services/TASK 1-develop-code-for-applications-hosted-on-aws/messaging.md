# Messaging

Messaging systems allow different components of an application to communicate asynchronously, decoupling the services. AWS offers several messaging services to support different use cases.

## Amazon SQS
**SQS** (Simple Queue Service) is a fully managed queue service that enables message queuing between distributed components. It supports both **Standard Queues** (high throughput) and **FIFO Queues** (guaranteed order).

## Amazon SNS
**SNS** (Simple Notification Service) allows you to send messages to multiple recipients, enabling publish/subscribe messaging patterns. It's useful for broadcasting notifications.

## Amazon MQ
**Amazon MQ** is a managed message broker service for Apache ActiveMQ and RabbitMQ, used for traditional messaging patterns and supporting complex integration scenarios.
