# AWS SDKs

AWS SDKs (Software Development Kits) are essential for interacting with AWS services programmatically. These SDKs are available for various programming languages and provide the necessary tools to access AWS APIs.

## Features
- **Automatic retries** with exponential backoff and jitter.
- **IAM integration** for secure access to AWS resources.
- **Service clients** for interacting with AWS services like S3, DynamoDB, Lambda, etc.

## Languages Supported
- Java
- Python (Boto3)
- JavaScript (AWS SDK for JavaScript)
- .NET
- Go, Ruby, PHP, and more

## Best Practices
- Use **IAM roles** for secure, least-privilege access.
- Enable **logging** to monitor AWS SDK usage.
