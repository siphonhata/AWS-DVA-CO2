# Stateful vs Stateless

Understanding whether your application needs to maintain state across sessions or be stateless is crucial in building scalable applications.

## Stateless
In stateless applications, each request is independent. No session data is stored between requests. Stateless systems scale easily and are simpler to manage.

Example: **AWS Lambda** functions are stateless by nature.

## Stateful
Stateful systems maintain session data or context over multiple requests. They often require storage solutions like databases or caches to persist information.

Example: **Amazon RDS** and **DynamoDB** are stateful services that store data persistently.
