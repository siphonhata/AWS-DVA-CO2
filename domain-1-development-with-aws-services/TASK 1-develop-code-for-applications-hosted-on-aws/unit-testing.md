# Unit Testing

Unit testing is an essential practice in software development that ensures individual components of your application work as expected.

## AWS Services for Testing
- **AWS SDKs** provide mock services for testing AWS interactions.
- **AWS Lambda** allows you to unit test individual functions with specific inputs and outputs.
- **Amazon API Gateway** can be tested with tools like **Postman** for API response verification.

## Best Practices
- Test each function in isolation.
- Use **AWS SDK Mocking** tools to simulate AWS service calls.
- Implement assertions to validate expected results.
